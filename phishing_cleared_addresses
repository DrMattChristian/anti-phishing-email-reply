#
# phishing_cleared_addresses is the list of addresses that have been confirmed 
# to have been cleared (secured).  
#
# The DATE is the date it was cleared.
#
# The add-address-to-list.pl script will check this file and remove any 
# addresses that have a cleared date that is more recent than the listing date
#
# There is no type included, since the type is not relevant to the
# determination of when the addresses are cleared.
#
# List Format:
#
# ADDRESS,DATE
#
# The list is in alphabetical order.
